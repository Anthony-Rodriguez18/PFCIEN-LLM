Alright Justine, so for this task I'm just going to show you one picture and I just want you to tell me everything you see happening. Okay. Here we are. The woman is washing the dishes and while she's doing that the water is overflowing. Then the boy is reaching for the cookie jar and while he's doing that the stool below him is falling and the girl is reaching for the cookie. Alright and what emotion does the girl look like she's expressing? Laugh. She's laughing at her, at the boy as he's falling? Her hands over her mouth. She's reaching for the cookie or the boy. Alright and if you look at the curtains here what do you think the weather is like? Windy and sunny. Alright very good.
