Hello, I'm Sarah Scott. But I'm going to hand this to Sarah and ask her to describe it. Yeah, so you can look at it Sarah. So can you describe what's in this picture? So, it's in the kitchen and there's two children and a mum. The children are eating some biscuits or cookies. And the boy is standing in the stool. But it's almost fallen over. The mum is cleaning the plates. But the sink is... The water is so full it's already spilling out. And the mum doesn't know that the children are eating the cookies. Good, good. So when you first looked at that, like shortly after your stroke, you could only do single words. So you're explaining in full sentences now, but it's still quite tricky, isn't it? Yeah.
